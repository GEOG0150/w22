How do geographers use this information to interpret changes in the global environment across space and time? In this course we will learn how to work with large geographic datasets to explore patterns and changes to the Earth\u2019s surface at local to global scales. Case studies will use remotely-sensed images to study land cover, climate, weather, wildfire, and other topics. Students will learn concepts, methods, and ethics for using a cloud-based geospatial analysis platform to process data, critically interpret workflows and results, and communicate findings with web maps and graphics.","title":"Description"},{"location":"evaluation/","text":"Your grade will be based on your participation in the course, three problem sets , and one comparative study . COMPONENT EXPECTATIONS Participation 10% Attend all class meetings, complete all homework assignments, participate in class activities. Provide prior notice if you must miss a meeting. Problem sets 20% each (60% total ) Work out complete, correct solutions. Comparative study, presentation, and narrative 10% each (30% total ) Develop a comparative study, conduct analysis, present findings visually and verbally, seek help when you need it, meet presentation deadline, incorporate peer feedback in final revision. Each problem set will consist of two phases : PHASE RULES 1 You will have 1 hour and 45 minutes of class time to independently work out solutions to a small set of problems. Most problems will be short, at least one will be a little longer. You may refer to your own notes and your previous work in the course, but you may not discuss the problems with anyone, except to ask for clarity about the problem descriptions. 2 You will have the next 24 hours to finish solving the problems. (Your final solutions are due on Friday at noon). You may receive assistance from instructors or by working with peers in this class. You may not receive assistance from former students of this class, unless they are approved teaching assistants. Each problem in the set will be graded based on your ability to work out solutions independently or with assistance: GRADE SOLUTION A Complete, correct solution at end of Phase 1 B Complete, correct solution at end of Phase 2 C Incomplete, incorrect solution at end of Phase 2 F Failure to complete or correct solution 72 hours after end of Phase 2","title":"Evaluation"},{"location":"outcomes/","text":"By the end of this course, you should be able to: select and manipulate geographic images with Earth Engine\u2019s javascript code editor define and apply concepts of remote sensing and geospatial analysis solve and trouble-shoot image processing workflows illustrate and interpret visual evidence of environmental change with words and pictures","title":"Outcomes"},{"location":"policies/","text":"Academic Integrity As an academic community devoted to the life of the mind, Middlebury requires of every student complete intellectual honesty in the preparation and submission of all academic work.
